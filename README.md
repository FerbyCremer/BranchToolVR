# BranchToolVR

A tool designed to map vascular systems present in medical images in virtual reality. The previous non-vr iteration of the tool can be found here: https://github.com/microdr/Branch-Tool

## TODO list:
* continue work on vein tracing using controller position
* transparent object depth sorting
* auto detect sensible windowing values
* data set testing
* clamp point cloud selector box within bounds
* fix bounding sphere generation and collision testing
* add isovalue coloring to static mesh
* refactor shaders
* combine proj and view matrices on cpu
* refactor screen ui
* sort points by isovalue for faster surface lookup
* declare const where possible in class functions
* add object manager class
* refactor code from other sources
* re-enable shadows
* refactor shaders to class objects
* add virtual draw function to inherited class
* point cloud culling
* refactor class/struct destructors
	* delete opengl data in renderer destructor
* refactor class privelages
* identify performance bottlenecks
* include all .psd and .blend files in repo
* add visual feedback to actions
* repository features
* assign object type ids automatically
* add selector cube model (remove transparency)
	* <sup>add compile instructions</sup>
	* <sup>create libraries zip in download section</sup>
	* <sup>uml documentation</sup>
* triangulate vein structures
* export triangulation
